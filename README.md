# rom-mover

One day I had this problem: My GB and GBC roms were mixed in the same directory.
Been a lazy person I made this simple script to check the zip files containing `.gbc` files and move them to the proper directory, along with the thumb files (the script assumes the thumb files are `.png` files with the same name as the rom files)

# Installation

```
$ yarn install
```

# Running

```
$ yarn dev
```
